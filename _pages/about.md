Hi, my name is Erfan Arefi, I'm a full stack developer and researcher in computer science, founder of `uniXerr` and a hungry learner.

I love sharing my abstract ideas and thoughts on computer science, technology especially artificial intelligence and coding with everyone, so I created this blog to write about them all. Hope you enjoy!
