Who would have thought that one day our codes would know each other or write some of their own?

Before we start, let's think about something together. Imagine there is a code that has the ability to heal itself, meaning that it could bring itself back to where it was before. Now do you think this is possible by any means?
As we all know, in the present world *everything can be everything*, so if we go ahead with this mindset, then we can find a code that can repair itself. But wait... what?! why?! I mean... 

Yes, I know there might be thousands of questions in your head, but I promise you to answer them all. If you want to know how it is possible, I will be explaining it thorughout this thread, so keep on reading and feed your curiosity.
Well, enough talking! let's dig into the fascinating  parts of this venturesome journey.
