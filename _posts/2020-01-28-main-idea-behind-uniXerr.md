Hi everyone, today I'm going to talk to you about the idea behind `uniXerr`.
I also wrote a brief post just for the purpose of knowing the name of the project that you can read from [here](https://unixerr.com/blog/2020/01/02/what-is-uniXerr/). 

# Spend from your credit!
It was about three months ago when I was walking home from university, I always found something to get my mind involved and this time I was thinking about why some things are not what I want them to be.
For example, why shouldn't I get a high score when I'm the only one who cares a lot about coding, but someone who doesn't know anything gets a good one? Well, I have to say that since `everything can be everything` I could have been them and they could have been me!
But I'm so glad now that I'm not them, anyway as I was struggling with myself why nothing is nothing suddenly a very abstract idea began to scratch my mind. Of course, thanks to recent computer science technologies, it cannot be said to be completely abstract but for many, it's still abstract.

Here is the idea, It would be great if anyone could earn as much credit as they did for their hard work.
And use that credit to get the score. Yes, I know thousands of questions are going to blow your mind to find their answers.
First of all, let me say that in the next few minutes you will understand why I use the word credit and second of all 
to understand the core of this idea, I suggest you read my post on [deep learning and artificial intelligence](https://unixerr.com/blog/2020/01/28/a-venturesome-journey-into-the-deep-learning/).


> But for now, I assume you all know about artificial intelligence.
> **At the time of writing this post I am currently working on the structure of this project and have not yet reached the production stage. But all parts of [this project](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr) are open source and you can contribute it.**

# Why did I use the word credit?
Well, the word credit refers to the amount of coins that the `uniXerr` protocol which is on top of AI gives you weekly based on one of your twenty positions, and your position can vary depending on the value of some predefined constant attributes (features) for this protocol.

There is a piece of bad news for those I mentioned in the previous section, no one can get a higher score unless their effort is high because everyone gets paid based on their merit and effort, the more the effort, the more coins that are mined.

Don't you find it interesting that you can get exactly what you deserve?!
To me, that is very cool because I think no one can complain to what they have achieved through their efforts.
I am very eager to implement this project as soon as possible and I will do my best to make this project the best it can be as a digital companion.

# Conclusion
When I got home I [created its slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GK3pkiIfIzD472j6eXYRZ59xo9yky3sYgX-_MpS9TX8/edit#slide=id.gc6f919934_0_0) like all the other ideas and I thought about the results and purposes it could have, so I want to share two of the most important ones to you that I hope to get as the main ones:

* Study and gaining credit at the same time.
* University progress in scientific and research fields.

Hope you have been answered most of your questions and enjoyed this post.
