Can we let AI know what it's doing?
Can we have consciousness for it?
Can we implement the abstract of inertia or force for our ASI?
Do we replace artificial intelligence with ourselves?

I know millions of other questions like these have to be answered, but for now let me say that
we can solve ASI  (Artificial Super Intelligence) dangerous and problems using a two way neuron wave collector which it can put/read thoughts in/from your mind like [double gainer idea](https://unixerr.com/blog/2020/01/30/a-digital-double-gainer-idea/). For that we have to build a security protocl like our ASI must prevent those bad thoughts like killing or wars from being happen, or no one can hear other thoughts.


I think there are a few who haven't seen the west world series.
